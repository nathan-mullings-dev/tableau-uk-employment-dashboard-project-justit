## 📘 Project Proposal

The purpose of this Tableau dashboard is to visualize and analyze employment trends across the United Kingdom between 2011 and 2014. This project aims to offer insights into which cities and industries experienced the most significant employment growth and to support data-driven decision-making for workforce planning, urban development, and economic policy.

### Objectives:

- Identify the **Top 10 industries and sub-industries** driving employment growth.
- Visualize **total jobs per city** with a focus on regional distribution in 2014.
- Show the **average percentage change in employment by city** to highlight local trends.
- Analyze industry-specific growth across key urban centers using color-coded indicators.
